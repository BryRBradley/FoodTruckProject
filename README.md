#### Technology used
. Eclipse IDE
. Github
. Sublime 
. MacOS terminal
. Java 
. Microsoft Word 
. Zoom and Slack for troubleshooting and Senior developer input
. UML 

#### Testing 	
. 23 Feb tested different user inputs to break the code logic: discovered and corrected mulitple issue 
. 24 Feb tested logic flow and user inputs, properly breaks out when and where it is required to. 
Code no longer accepts other inputs than what is requested. 

#### Lessons and Review topics
. Clearer understanding of getters and setter in pulling data from non-public classses.
. Correlation CLass interaction nd meening of setting class data type/return.
. First time creating a UML for a poject. For me as a newbie programmer it helped me to have
  an outline of the logic and requirements that  I need to achieve. in addition it was a method to translate my thought into code. 
. Review 

#### Coding hours and to do
. 23 Feb 3.5 hours UML production, V1 and V2 of the App
. 24 Feb 2 hour V3 of App, Solving a logic flow problem, README and refactoring.
. 25 Feb (planned) 1 hour final code review and final GIT push. 
. Improve README.md

##### Project goals
1. Write a program that meets all requested requirements.
 2. Increase my speed of coding and familiaritaion with the how and why of Java syntax.
 3. Develop more confidence in my end result and ability to achieve it.
 4. Break up the coding session so i can go at my own pace to really absorb the lesson learned and coding time with no pressure.
